When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you want to share or collaborate with other coders.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Better to pull manually so that you can keep track of what changes are coming in. If people are working simultaneously on a project, things may not be ready to merge until later.
