You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

I've already completed later projects, but wanted to go back and see the "new" Project 0 and intro material. So from this particular unit I haven't learned much this time around. 

- <figure> is a cool HTML5 tag!
- Udacity Chrome extension is a nice feature
- I'm excited that my Udacity progress is now easier to track; makes goal setting much easier

Thanks for all the improvements!
